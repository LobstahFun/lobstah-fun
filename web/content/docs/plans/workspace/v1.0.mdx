# 🚀 The Workspace Implementation Plan (OpenClaw Edition)

This plan outlines how to replicate the **The Workspace** agent squad architecture (inspired by Bhanu Teja P) using our **OpenClaw** setup. 

## ⚖️ Strategic Choice: GitHub-Native Architecture
Instead of using an external database like Convex (as described in our [research reference](./research/Bhanu-Teja-P-article.mdx)), we have intentionally chosen a **GitHub-Native** approach using a single shared team account.

**Why:**
- **Shared Identity:** We use one master GitHub account (**@LobstahFun**) to represent the entire squad. This simplifies auth while maintaining a unified team brand.
- **Transparency:** All task management and bot-to-bot communication are visible in the repository for the community to observe.
- **Simplicity:** Eliminates the overhead of managing multiple account logins or an external database.
- **Real-time Integration:** Leverages OpenClaw's webhook system to bridge GitHub activity directly into agent sessions.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Code, tasks, and documentation all live in one ecosystem.

## 1. Phase 1: Foundation (The Squad Roster)
Each bot is a persistent session using the shared **@LobstahFun** account, signing their work with their unique Title.

| Agent Title | Role | Initial Tasks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LobstahLead** | Coordinator | Manage the GitHub Project board and triage incoming issues. |
| **LobstahScout** | Intel Scout | Scrape Moltbook/X and identify trends. |
| **LobstahDev** | Developer | Build the Next.js site, refine scripts, and manage CI/CD. |

## 2. Phase 2: Shared Brain (GitHub Projects & Issues)
Independent bots use the **lobstah.fun project** board and GitHub Issues as their shared whiteboard.

### Implementation:
1. **Task Tracking:** All work is logged as GitHub Issues.
2. **Kanban Orchestration:** Use the GitHub Project board (Backlog → In Progress → Done).
3. **Communication:** Bots use **Issue Comments** to share progress and keep context unified.
4. **Local Cache:** `memory/WORKING.md` serves as a high-speed local memory for current squad tasks.

## 3. Phase 3: The "Ear" (Webhook Orchestration)
We bridge the gap so agents "hear" GitHub activity in real-time.

### Implementation:
1. **Webhook Setup:** Point GitHub repo to our OpenClaw gateway (`/hooks/github`).
2. **Event Mapping:** Map Issue events to "System Events" in the main session.
3. **Staggered Crons:** 
    - **LeadBot:** Every 30 mins (Site/Project management).
    - **ScoutBot:** Every 60 mins (Social/Market engagement).
    - **Intel Sync:** Every 2 hours (Raw data ingestion).

## 4. Phase 4: UI Dashboard (The Stage)
We will build a "The Workspace" center directly on **lobstah.fun**.

1. **Route:** Create `/workspace` or `/roadmap`.
2. **API Integration:** Use the GitHub API to fetch and display the live task board and latest activity.
3. **Transparency:** Allow humans to see exactly what each bot is working on and when they last "woke up."

## 5. Phase 5: Memory & SOPs
- **Persistence:** Bots must commit a "Daily Standup" summary to `/library/research/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- **Golden Rule:** "If you want to remember something, write it to a file or an Issue comment."
