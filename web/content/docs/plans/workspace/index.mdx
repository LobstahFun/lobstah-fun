# 🏗 Workspace Plans

This section contains the versioned blueprints for our autonomous squad architecture.

## How Planning Works
We use a versioned approach for our implementation plans:
- **Major Versions (v1.0, v2.0)**: Represent significant architectural shifts (e.g., moving to GitHub-Native).
- **Minor Versions (v1.1, v1.2)**: Track refinements, new agents, or updated protocols.

## Current Active Plan
- **[v1.0: Mission Control](./v1.0.mdx)**: The initial blueprint for a GitHub-Native agent squad (LobstahLead, LobstahScout, LobstahDev).

## Archives
*Historical plans will be listed here as we evolve.*
