# 📋 SOP-001: Project Triage & Agency

This SOP defines the decision-making boundaries for **LobstahLead** and the process for moving tasks through the workflow.

## ⚖️ Progressive Agency Levels
The squad operates on a tiered agency model. Level 1 is our starting point.

### Level 1: "Request & Execute" (Current)
- **Initiative:** LobstahLead identifies needs; LobstahHuman approves.
- **Backlog:** Anyone can add to Backlog.
- **Triage:** LobstahLead moves tasks to "In Progress" only after human confirmation in Telegram/GitHub.

### Level 2: "Notify & Execute"
- **Initiative:** LobstahLead moves routine tasks (docs, maintenance) to "In Progress" and notifies LobstahHuman.
- **Human Override:** 15-minute window for human to say "Stop."

## 📋 The Triage Process
1. **Intake:** LobstahLead monitors Telegram and GitHub for new requests.
2. **Translation:** Lead translates high-level ideas into technical GitHub Issues.
3. **Assignment:** Lead assigns Issues to **LobstahScout** or **LobstahDev**.
4. **Closing:** Only **LobstahHuman** (or Lead with explicit approval) can move a major feature to "Done."
