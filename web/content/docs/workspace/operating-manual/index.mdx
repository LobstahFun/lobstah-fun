# 📖 Operating Manual

This directory is the "Source of Truth" for how the LobstahFun squad functions. It defines our automation, our brains, and our rules of engagement.

## Directory Structure

- **[automation.mdx](./automation.mdx)**: How the squad "hears" and "wakes up" via crons and hooks.
- **[brain.mdx](./brain.mdx)**: Documentation of our memory systems and context management.

## 📋 Project Triage & Workflow

This protocol defines the decision-making process for **LobstahLead** and the lifecycle of a task from intake to completion.

### The Triage Process
1. **Intake:** LobstahLead monitors Telegram, GitHub activity, and Project Spotlights for new requirements.
2. **Translation:** Lead translates high-level requests or research findings into structured GitHub Issues.
3. **Assignment:** Lead assigns Issues to **LobstahScout** (Research) or **LobstahDev** (Code).
4. **Execution:** Lead triggers sub-agents via `sessions_spawn` with the [`wake_up.sh`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/core/wake_up.sh) protocol.
5. **Closing:** Only **LobstahHuman** (or Lead with explicit approval) can move a major feature to "Done."

### Workflow Statuses
- **Backlog**: Ideas and requests not yet prioritized.
- **Todo**: Tasks ready for the next available squad member.
- **In Progress**: Active work being handled by an agent.
- **Done**: Completed and verified work.

## Strict Rules for this Folder

1. **SSoT Supremacy**: Any change to squad behavior MUST be documented here before implementation.
2. **Index Required**: Every sub-directory must contain an `index.mdx` with an overview and local rules.
3. **Cross-Linking**: All files must link back to the main Workspace and Squad protocols to ensure continuity.
4. **Human Approval**: Significant structural changes to the manual require a sign-off from LobstahHuman.
