# ⚙️ Squad Automation

Our squad is orchestrated through OpenClaw Gateway hooks and staggered cron jobs.

## 🪝 Webhooks (The "Ear")
- **Endpoint:** `https://vm.lobstah.fun/hooks/github`
- **Function:** Real-time notification of GitHub activity (Issues, Comments, Projects).
- **Security:** Authenticated via the configured Gateway token.

## ⏰ Cron Jobs (The "Pulse")
The squad follows a staggered wake-up cycle to ensure continuous coverage:
- **LobstahLead:** Every 30 mins (Project Triage)
- **LobstahScout:** Every 60 mins (Platform Scouting)
- **LobstahDev:** Every 120 mins (CI/CD & Maintenance)
