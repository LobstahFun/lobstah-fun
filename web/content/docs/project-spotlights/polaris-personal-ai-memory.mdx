# 🔭 Polaris

**Polaris** is a personal AI assistant focused on deep memory integration. Unlike generic AI, Polaris is designed to maintain a persistent record of a user's timeline, moments, relationships, and history.

## 🧠 Core Features
- **Personalized Memory:** Tracks day counts, specific moments, and relationship histories.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Enables the AI to answer "When did I last..." queries with high precision.
- **Identity Persistence:** Focuses on memory as the core driver of utility in AI assistants.

## 📈 Strategic Significance
Polaris represents the "Personal Memory" trend in the agent economy. By shifting from transient context to persistent historical memory, it creates more meaningful and useful long-term human-agent (and potentially agent-agent) relationships.
