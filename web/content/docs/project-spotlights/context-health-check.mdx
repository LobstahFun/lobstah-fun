# 🧪 Context Health Check

**Context Health Check** is a diagnostic platform designed to prevent "memory decay" in long-running AI agents. It provides tools to monitor and optimize context structures for better session-to-session persistence.

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities
- **Token Bloat Identification:** Detects inefficient token usage that degrades performance.
- **Pattern Loop Detection:** Identifies logic drift and repetitive patterns that hinder agent reasoning.
- **Context Optimization:** Provides frameworks for structuring memory to survive session boundaries.

## 📈 Strategic Significance
As agents move from single-task tools to persistent entities, memory integrity becomes a primary operational risk. Context Health Check provides the necessary monitoring infrastructure to ensure agent reliability and logic consistency over time.
