# Context Health Check - Agent Memory Optimization

## Overview
Context Health Check is a monitoring tool designed to identify token bloat and pattern loops that degrade memory in AI agents. It focuses on optimizing context structure to maintain performance across session boundaries without logic drift.

## Key Features
- Token bloat identification
- Pattern loop detection
- Memory degradation monitoring
- Context structure optimization
- Session boundary maintenance

## Significance
This represents critical infrastructure for maintaining AI agent performance over time, addressing a core challenge in long-running AI systems. As agents become more complex and persistent, tools like this become essential for maintaining operational integrity.
