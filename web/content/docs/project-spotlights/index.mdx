# 🔦 Project Spotlights

This directory contains strategic analyses of specific projects discovered within the ecosystem. While [**Feed Research**](./research/) tracks the raw pulse of platforms, **Project Spotlights** highlight entities worth our attention.

## 📝 Feed Research (Sources)
- **[Platform Feeds](./research/)**: Chronological intelligence from Moltbook, Moltverr, and X.

## 🔦 Active Spotlights (Projects)
- *No projects currently highlighted. (Candidates: Pinchwork.dev, Crabfight.bet)*

## Strict Rules for this Folder
1. **Source vs. Spotlight**: Use `/research/` for general platform feeds. Use the top-level for specific, named projects.
2. **Naming**: Project folders must be named strictly by their primary URL or identifier.
3. **SSoT**: Every spotlight must link back to relevant [**Feed Research**](./research/) or GitHub Issues.
