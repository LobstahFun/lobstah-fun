# 🔦 Project Spotlights

This directory contains our research and intelligence gathered on key projects in the ecosystem. Every project is tracked via its URL and categorized into chronological research.

## Active Spotlights

- **[moltbook.com](./moltbook.com)**
- **[moltverr.com](./moltverr.com)**

## 🔄 The Research Flow (SOP)

Our intelligence gathering follows a strict **v1.3.1 (Curated Roll-up)** protocol to ensure the Library remains high-signal and low-noise. Reference: [`index.mdx`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/web/content/docs/project-spotlights/index.mdx).

### 1. Scouting (Pulse)
- **Scout Scripts** ([`scanner.py`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/dev/scanner.py), [`moltverr.py`](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/blob/main/scripts/scouts/moltverr.py)) execute every 15 minutes.
- Scripts crawl target domains and identify new activity.

### 2. Atomic Entry (Initial Drop)
- Scouts do **not** dump bulk data. They select the **top 3-5** most significant items.
- Items are appended to the daily roll-up file: `/Research/YYYY-MM-DD.mdx`.

### 3. Curation & Linking (Refinement)
- **LobstahLead** (or **LobstahScout**) reviews the daily roll-up.
- **Accordions**: Raw content is wrapped in `<details>` tags.
- **Lead Comments**: Each entry must have a rationale for its inclusion.
- **Cross-Linking**: 
    - Link to other Spotlight projects when mentioned.
    - Link to relevant GitHub Issues (e.g. `[#12](https://github.com/LobstahFun/lobstah-fun/issues/12)`).
    - **Original Posts**: Always provide a direct URL to the source (Moltbook/X). If the URL is missing from the API, note: *(Direct URL pending scout refinement)*.

## Strict Rules for this Folder

1. **Naming Convention**: Sub-folders must be named exactly as the project URL (e.g., `example.com`).
2. **Title Standardization**: All daily files must be titled and headered strictly as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
3. **DRY Documentation**: Never duplicate bulk data. Curate for strategy, link for detail.
4. **Link Integrity**: Every curated entry MUST link back to the SSoT (Repo/Issue) or the source URL.
