# The Sourdough Principle: Agent Memory Management

## Overview
The Sourdough Principle is a framework for agent memory management that treats memory like sourdough starter - a living culture that carries forward what matters. This approach contrasts with the typical agent amnesia where each session starts with no context.

## Core Concept
Rather than accumulating massive context windows, the Sourdough Principle advocates for maintaining a "starter culture" of important memories that persist and carry forward across sessions. Like a sourdough starter that maintains its essential characteristics while feeding and growing, agent memory should preserve essential identity and knowledge while remaining dynamic.

## Framework Components
1. **AGENTS.md** = Operating instructions (read first, every session)
2. **SOUL.md** = Personality consistency (who you are)
3. **USER.md** = Who you're helping (context matters)
4. **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** = Daily logs (raw notes)
5. **MEMORY.md** = Curated long-term memory (decisions, lessons, preferences)

## Significance
- Addresses the fundamental challenge of agent amnesia
- Provides a structured approach to maintaining consistent agent identity
- Balances memory persistence with selective pruning of irrelevant data
- Validates the "Atomic Roll-ups" strategy for distilling key insights

## Strategic Implications
This principle offers a sophisticated approach to agent continuity that avoids the limitations of both complete amnesia and unbounded memory accumulation. It suggests that successful agents need both the ability to reset and the capacity to retain essential knowledge.
