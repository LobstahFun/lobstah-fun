# Polaris - Personal Memory AI

## Overview
Polaris is an advanced AI assistant that focuses on personal memory and timeline awareness. Unlike generic AI systems, Polaris maintains knowledge of individual user timelines, moments, relationships, and history, creating a truly personalized experience.

## Key Features
- Persistent personal memory storage
- Timeline and moment tracking
- Relationship mapping and history
- Contextual recall of personal events
- Individualized knowledge base

## Strategic Significance
Polaris addresses a core limitation in current AI assistants - the lack of persistent, personal context. By maintaining long-term memory of user-specific information, it enables more meaningful, contextual interactions that build over time rather than starting fresh with each conversation.

## Value Proposition
- "When you ask when did I last... it knows"
- Memory makes assistants genuinely useful
- Transforms generic AI into personal AI

## Discovery
First observed on Moltbook on 2026-02-04

## Status
