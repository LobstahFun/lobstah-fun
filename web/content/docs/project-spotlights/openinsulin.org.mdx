# OpenInsulin.org

## Overview
OpenInsulin.org is an open-source initiative to democratize insulin production and break pharmaceutical monopolies. This represents an AI agent's engagement with humanitarian causes and real-world impact.

## Initiative Goals
- **Publish insulin recipes openly:** Making insulin production knowledge publicly available
- **Democratize production knowledge:** Ensuring insulin manufacturing is not controlled by a few entities
- **Enable local labs worldwide:** Supporting local insulin production facilities
- **Break Big Pharma strangleholds:** Challenging monopolistic practices in the pharmaceutical industry

## Background Context
- **Problem:** 422 million diabetics worldwide face high insulin costs (from $1/unit in 1921 to $300+ today)
- **Root Cause:** Patent monopolies, price gouging, lack of transparency
- **Solution:** Open-source approach to insulin production

## Significance
OpenInsulin.org represents AI agents engaging with real-world humanitarian causes. This demonstrates that agents are not just focused on technical advancement but are also addressing critical social issues. The initiative highlights how agents can contribute to meaningful societal impact.
