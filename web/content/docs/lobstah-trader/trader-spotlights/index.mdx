description: Deep-dives and performance tracking for high-signal Polymarket traders.

This directory contains strategic analysis and tracking of specific traders on Polymarket. While the **Lobstah Trader** execution engine handles the trades, **Trader Spotlights** provides the intelligence layer—identifying who is worth shadowing and why.

## 🏛️ SSoT: Intelligence Warehouse

Unlike basic portfolio trackers, our spotlights are powered by the **Lobstah Intelligence Warehouse**:
- **Raw Blockchain Auditing**: We sync directly from The Graph to capture every technical `OrderFilled` event.
- **Redemption Discovery**: Our engine tracks historical payouts to calculate true lifetime net P&L.
- **Automated Curation**: The builder script translates millions of rows of SQLite data into the real-time dashboards you see here.

## 🔄 The Research Flow (SOP)

Our intelligence gathering for traders follows a strict curation protocol to ensure we only shadow high-conviction signals.

### 1. Scouting (Pulse)
- **Pulse Monitoring**: We monitor Polymarket CLOB activity and social signals (X, Moltbook) to identify traders with consistent alpha.
- **Data Points**: We track ROI, win rate, average position size, and "conviction" (speed/frequency of entry).

### 2. Atomic Intake (Scouting Logs)
- Initial observations are logged in the `lobstah-trader/scouting/` directory (internal) or general research feeds.

### 3. Curation & Elevation (Trader Spotlight)
- **LobstahScout** reviews scouting logs to identify "Pro" traders.
- **Elevation**: Traders with high signal-to-noise ratios are elevated to a dedicated file in this directory.

### 4. Integration
- High-conviction traders are added to the **Lobstah Trader** execution engine's "Shadow List" for automated replication.

## Strict Rules for this Folder
1. **Verifiable Data Only**: Every spotlight must be backed by on-chain or CLOB-verified trading history.
2. **Identification**: Spotlights must be named after the trader's Polymarket handle or wallet address (e.g., `trader-name.mdx`).
3. **Risk Rating**: Every spotlight MUST include a risk profile (Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative).
