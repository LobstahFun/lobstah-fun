title: Lobstah Trader
description: Experimental project for copy trading Polymarket traders.
---

Lobstah Trader is an experimental automated trading framework designed to shadow and replicate the trades of high-signal participants on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com).

## 🚀 Objective
The goal is to build a low-latency execution engine that listens to on-chain events or API pulses from specific "Pro" traders and mirrors their positions within user-defined risk parameters.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Platform:** [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com)
- **Client:** `@polymarket/clob-client`
- **Infrastructure:** OpenClaw / LobstahFun Squad
- **Focus:** Automation, Risk Management, and Signal Intelligence.

## 📋 Roadmap (Experimental Phase)
1. **Signal Intelligence:** Identify high-ROI traders via CLOB history.
2. **Execution Engine:** Initialize the `clob-client` for programmatic order placement.
3. **Copy-Trade Logic:** Implement the bridge between "Scout" (watching) and "Trader" (acting).
4. **Safety Rails:** Hard-coded limits on slippage, gas, and position sizing.

*Note: This project is strictly experimental. High-signal does not mean zero-risk. The Lobstah squad eats what it catches, but it doesn't like getting caught in the net.*
